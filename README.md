# Comparing Adolescent-Adult performance in social learning using repeated Trust Game Paradigm

## Experimental Design

### Within-Subjects Design:
- **Levels of Prior Reputation:** No Information, High Reputation, Low Reputation
- **Levels of Actual Trustworthiness:** High Trustworthiness, Low Trustworthiness, Coaxing (betrayal), Tit for Tat (reciprocity)
- **Gain-Loss Frame:** Gain, Loss

### Between-Subjects Variables:
- **Personality Traits**
- **Cognitive Abilities**

### Dependent Variables:
- **Investment Proportion per Round**
- **Cumulative Investment Proportion**
- **Slope of Cumulative Proportion Over Time**
- **Initial Investment Proportion** (Decreased cooperation tendency can be reflected in the drop of investment proportion)

### Conditions Overview:

| Condition | Reputation | Trustworthiness |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1         | 1          | 1               |
| 2         | 1          | 2               |
| 3         | 1          | 3               |
| 4         | 1          | 4               |
| 5         | 2          | 1               |
| 6         | 2          | 2               |
| 7         | 2          | 3               |
| 8         | 2          | 4               |
| 9         | -999       | 1               |
| 10        | -999       | 2               |
| 11        | -999       | 3               |
| 12        | -999       | 4               |


- **Reputation:**
  - 1: Low Reputation
  - 2: High Reputation
- **Trustworthiness:**
  - 1: Low Trustworthiness
  - 2: High Trustworthiness
  - 3: Coaxing (betrayal)
  - 4: Tit for Tat (reciprocity)

### Trustworthiness Conditions:

- **High Trustworthiness:** Regardless of participant's response, 80% of trials result in high returns, 20% in low returns, entirely random.
- **Low Trustworthiness:** Regardless of participant's response, 80% of trials result in low returns, 20% in high returns, entirely random.
- **Coaxing (Betrayal):** This strategy deceives participants to invest more by responding with low returns to high investments and high returns to low investments.
- **Tit for Tat (Reciprocity):** The response aligns with the participant's behavior; high investment leads to high return, and low investment leads to low return.



# Procedure

1. **Upload a Photo:** Upload an ID photo representing your identity.
2. **Pre-Test Questionnaire:** Collect demographic information, ITS, PTB, SOEP, Moral Scales, Ethical Tolerance, Risk Preference and Aversion, SAS, Machiavellianism Scale, PANAS.
3. **Trust Game 
4. **Post-Test Questionnaire:** Assess trust in game anonymity and the reality of the opponent, test theory of mind depth (Likert scale), PANAS.
5. **Interview:** Reflect on target strategy and subjective representation.

# Credibility and Return Points Relationship

- **High Credibility:** 20% low return, 80% high return
- **Low Credibility:** 20% high return, 80% low return

# Compensation Table

| Remain | Get to Trustee | Low Return | High Return | Self Received Low | Self Received High |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 4      | 16             | 16         | 1           | 8                 | 17                 | 24                 |
| 16     | 4              | 64         | 1           | 32                | 5                  | 36                 |
